# Coach Finder 

### [Coach Finder](https://coachfinder-fc75c.web.app/coaches) specializes in providing tech support through coaches with experience in frontend, backend or career expertise. Those who need more assistance and guidance in navigating a career in tech can hire a coach to help them in their learning journey. Potential coaches can sign up as a coach to list their skills for others who may want to reach out for their assistance. Other coaches are welcome to interact with one another for assistance as well but you are welcome to use the site exclusively to help others.
